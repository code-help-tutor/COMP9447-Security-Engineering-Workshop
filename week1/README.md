## Project Kickoff
Monday, September 14th, 8:30AM - 9:30AM\
Zoom link (recorded): https://unsw.zoom.us/j/95199340741

We know this is a bit last minute for everyone, but unfortunately this is the only time that all AWS mentors are available. During this session, you will meet your team for the first time and find a common time to meet. 

**If you are unable to make the session, please send me (christopher.shi@unsw.edu.au) an email detailing your availabilities so I can pass them onto your tutors and mentors who can factor it in when deciding a common time to meet.** 

We understand there are a couple students who are working full time and may not be able to find a mutual time with the AWS mentors. If this is the case, your team will find the best compatible session (recorded), and your mentors/tutors will work with you to make sure you don't miss out on the overall experience.
