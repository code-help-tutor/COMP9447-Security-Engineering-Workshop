# Week 2 

## Todo
- Begin considering how you want to build your SOAR application. Your tutors and mentors will give you tips and guidance on where to start this week.
- Maintain your self-reflection journals

## AWS Credits
You should all have gotten 2 x $100 credit codes for you to use on your group accounts.

I also have a lot of $50 credit codes for individual use and experimentation. 

If you have any accounts that have outstanding balances from self-paced labs or if you would like to do more experimentation please feel free to message me on discord and I will give you credits.

No one is expected to pay out of their own pocket for AWS fees, so please let one of the tutors or admin know as soon as possible if there are any billing problems.

## Course Updates
4 unique zoom links have been created and given to your tutors that you can use at any time.
These zoom links are set to automatically record, automatically allow screen sharing, and a link for each recording will be sent to all the tutors.
