# Week 0 aka Sorry

We want to maximise the amount of time you get to spend on your project so we're starting this week early with some material and labs you can do in your own time to familiarise yourself with AWS and their offerings.

## Todo
* Make sure you're enrolled in the course via myUNSW. Everyone should be whitelisted and able to enrol now. If you come across problems please email me.
